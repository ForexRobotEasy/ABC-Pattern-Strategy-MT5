## Description

This code implements the ABC Pattern Strategy for MetaTrader 5 (MT5) trading platform. The strategy aims to identify ABC chart patterns in price movements and utilize Fibonacci retracement levels to detect potential trend reversals or continuations.

## How it Works

The code consists of three main sections: ABC Chart Patterns Recognition, Fibonacci Levels Integration, and Trading Functionality.

### ABC Chart Patterns Recognition

The function `ABCPatternRecognition()` is responsible for identifying ABC chart patterns in price movements. This section of the code needs to be implemented with specific algorithms to detect the patterns.

### Fibonacci Levels Integration

The functions `CalculateFibonacciLevels()` and `DisplayFibonacciLevels()` are used to calculate and display Fibonacci retracement and extension levels. These levels are important in determining potential support and resistance levels in the market.

### Trading Functionality

The functions `PlaceOrder()`, `SetStopLoss()`, `SetTakeProfit()`, `ExecuteTrade()`, and `MonitorTrades()` are responsible for executing and managing trades based on the ABC Pattern Strategy and Fibonacci levels. These functions need to be implemented with the appropriate trading logic.

## Usage

1. Define the necessary input parameters such as Take Profit, Stop Loss, and Fibonacci Level.
2. Call the functions in the `OnStart()` function in the desired order:
   - `ABCPatternRecognition()`: Identifies ABC chart patterns.
   - `CalculateFibonacciLevels()`: Calculates Fibonacci retracement and extension levels.
   - `DisplayFibonacciLevels()`: Displays the relevant Fibonacci levels on the trading platform.
   - `PlaceOrder()`: Places a trade order.
   - `SetStopLoss()`: Sets the stop-loss level for the open trade.
   - `SetTakeProfit()`: Sets the take-profit level for the open trade.
   - `ExecuteTrade()`: Executes the trade order.
   - `MonitorTrades()`: Monitors and manages open trades based on the ABC Pattern Strategy and Fibonacci levels.
